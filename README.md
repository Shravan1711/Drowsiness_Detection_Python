# Drowsiness_Detection_Python
It is machine learning based model used for detecting the drowsiness of a person. Can be used in vehicals.


model.py - Used to train the model using my dataset consisting of images with open and closed eyes and train them. Now as a result the output H5 file is too large to be even compressed so i am adding link to the pre-trained models. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F4xD1BdZLRfBk9DAT3nqBjT4yZiqJOPX/view?usp=sharing

detect.py - is the actual code that reads the eyes status from the user and beeps an alarm after some time if the user's eyes are still closed.
